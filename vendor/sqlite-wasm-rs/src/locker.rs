//! Wrap the Mutex and Rwlock lock.
//!
//! In a single thread, when atomics is not enabled, use the lock provided by the standard library.
//! There will be no deadlock unless there is a recursive call.
//!
//! In multithreading, when atomics is enabled, use parking_lot, it will not cause lock poisoning
